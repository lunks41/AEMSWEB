## Project Overview
This project is a modular, multi-branch management system designed to streamline operations across distributed branches while maintaining data integrity and role-based access control. It empowers organizations to manage customers, suppliers, projects, accounts, HRMS, and administrative tasks efficiently, with branch-specific data isolation and user permissions.

### **Key Features**  

#### **1. Authentication & Access Control**  
- **Branch-Wise Login**: Users log in to a specific branch, ensuring access to branch-specific data.  
- **Role-Based Access**: Permissions are dynamically assigned based on user roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Employee) within their branch.  

#### **2. Dashboard & Navigation**  
- **Branch Selection**: Post-login, users can switch between authorized branches via a centralized dashboard.  
- **Multi-Branch Accessibility**: Open and manage multiple branches simultaneously (e.g., in separate tabs/windows) for seamless multitasking.  

#### **3. Data Management**  
- **BranchID-Driven Data Isolation**: All data (e.g., transactions, records) is tagged and filtered using a unique `branchId` to prevent cross-branch data leaks.  

#### **4. Modules & Features**  
**Master Module**:  
- Manage core entities:  
  - Customers, Suppliers, Banks, Accounts, and other foundational data.  

**Project Module**:  
- **Job Handling**: Track project workflows, assignments, and timelines.  
- **Customer-Specific Tariffs**: Define pricing structures per customer.  
- **Quotations**: Generate and manage quotes for services/products.  

**Account Module**:  
- Handle financial transactions, invoicing, and expense tracking.  

**HRMS Module**:  
- Employee records, attendance, payroll, and performance management.  

**Setting Module**:  
- Customize configurations (e.g., notifications, themes, regional settings).  

**Admin Module**:  
- **Document Number Maintenance**: Define numbering formats for invoices, orders, etc.  
- **User & Role Management**: Create roles, assign permissions, and manage user profiles.  
- **Audit Logs**: Track system changes and user activities for compliance.  

#### **5. Security & Compliance**  
- Role-based permissions ensure users access only authorized data.  
- Data encryption and audit trails for sensitive operations.
